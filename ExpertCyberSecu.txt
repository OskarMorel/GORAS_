How did you get hacked ?
Do you want us to try to recover your data knowing that we are not sure we will be able to recover it?
ok, we'll take care of it
What should we do then?
Do you intend to pay?
I can try to kill the malware so you won't have any more problems, if you want?
Why are you calling me then? What should I do?
Are your servers hosted externally? 
Sorry we can't do anything
You can ask your server host to retrieve former data. Would you like me to do this for you ?
Was it only your company that was attacked or only your hosting company ?
That means I can't do much. Your data is not in your company. We can only hope that your remote server has a former backup so that we can return the data to you uncorrupted.
Do you have former backups of your servers ?
When do you want me to come and load the data ?
Okay, can I come tomorrow to load the former data for you? 
I can do no more for you. Do you want me to come and do safety campaigns to prevent this from happening again ?
It will be difficult to recover your data. Do you want us to try to recover as much of your data as possible and remove the malware ?
